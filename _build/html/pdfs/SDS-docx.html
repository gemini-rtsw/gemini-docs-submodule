<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>The following document is a compilation of all standards and rules that
will guide any Real Time Software development process within the Gemini
Software Group. The main focus of the document is the Application
Development Environment (ADE), its components, its use cases and the
usage standards. The document also covers concepts and standards about
managing external software (e.g. EPICS, RTEMS, etc.). The goal is to
have clear guidelines to follow when starting any type of development
process, be it new projects or routine maintenance tasks.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The Application Development Environment to support the Gemini Real-Time
System software development process consists of the following
components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A comprehensive directory structure which is maintained in a file
system accessible to all developers and operational systems. The
directory structure defines locations which reflect the module type
(ioc or support module) and maturity (work or production).</li>
<li>A build server thatâs in charge of compiling and installing new
releases into the production area. The server always checks the
software to build out from the repository. This ensures that what is
built is reproducible from the repository.</li>
<li>A source code control system, based on Subversion along with a set of
Python scripts that work with Subversion to standardize the processes
in the software development cycle. Only source code and static
configuration files are stored in the ADE Subversion repository.</li>
<li>A Build system based on GNU Make. The standard EPICS Build
conventions are adopted, with enhancements including new Make rules,
additional templates, macros, configuration files and consistency
checking features.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="software-module-types">
<h2>Software Module Types<a class="headerlink" href="#software-module-types" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The following two types of software module are supported by the ADE:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Support Module</strong>â: This is an EPICS software module which is
intended to be used by another application or support module.
â<strong>Typically it will consist of the software that implements a
specific control system (e.g. the TCS or ECS), provides EPICS device
or driver support software or provides a software library.</strong></li>
<li><strong>IOC Application</strong>â: This comprises the set of files which will be
loaded and run on a specific IOC, making use of software from one or
more Support Modules.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-maturity-categories">
<h2>Software Maturity Categories<a class="headerlink" href="#software-maturity-categories" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The Gemini ADE categorizes software modules according to their
âmaturityâ, which is a measure of their apparent stability and
reliability. The ADE distinguishes three levels of software maturity:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Unreleased software</strong>â: This software is not handled as part of
the development environment and does not have a location in the
standard ADE directory structure. This is software in its initial
development and test stage which is not yet available for use by
other users. The development and test work will typically be
performed in a developerâs home directory area. It is not required
for unreleased software to be committed to the repository.</li>
<li><strong>Work software</strong>â: This software is in a âready for initial use
with the real hardwareâ state but is considered to be under test and
not ready for final release. It would typically be used during
commissioning or engineering periods, but is not intended to be used
during routine operations. It should be of a sufficient quality to
allow it to be used in other IOC applications than the associated
test application. The work software is installed in work by checking
out from the trunk or a branch. Work software should have a minimum
level of maturity such that: (a) it is defined in the ADE repository
structure as a support module or ioc, and (b) it can build without
errors after checking it out from the repository.</li>
<li><strong>Production software (prod)</strong>â. This software is in a well-tested
state, ready for routine operational use. It will normally have been
previously located in the work area. The software is released and
installed using the ADE tools and is protected with read-only access.
Multiple versions of production release software modules can be
maintained simultaneously. The software will have an associated
version name, which corresponds to a tag in the repository, and a
RELEASE.NOTES file describing the changes introduced in each version.
Production software has the essential quality that it is committed to
the repository as a tagged release, so it is traceable. This is
enforced by the ADE tools.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vendor-software">
<h2>Vendor Software<a class="headerlink" href="#vendor-software" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Vendor software is any software imported from outside Gemini like EPICS
modules or any other software. The ADE provides scripts to manage vendor
software within the ADE in a separate area of the Subversion repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ioc-types">
<h2>IOC Types<a class="headerlink" href="#ioc-types" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The ADE is designed to build and install software for all types of EPICS
IOCS, including RTEMS and VxWorks (hardware) IOCs as well as Soft Linux
IOCs.</p>
<p>A Soft IOC is an EPICS IOC running on a non-embedded Linux host. There
can be more than one Soft IOC per Linux host. A soft IOC normally does
not depend on any hardware on the host with the exception of standard
communications interfaces such as Ethernet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-dependencies">
<h2>Software Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#software-dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>An IOC application or support module will usually depend on specific
versions of one or more software support modules, either in production
(prod) or work. It will always also depend on an specific version of
EPICS.</p>
<p>Modules in work can depend on modules in work or prod. The dependencies
in prod should be preferred over the ones in work unless thereâs a good
reason not to. This will make easier to release the module to production
later.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances a released module in prod should depend on
modules in work (or even worse, unreleased modules). If thereâs the
need, for instance in an IOC application, to use a new feature from a
module in work, then the whole IOC should be moved to work for testing
with the new feature(s) during the day. Once the tests are complete, the
support module(s) and IOC can be released to prod following the
guidelines in section 3.</p>
<p>The file called â<strong>RELEASE</strong>â in the applicationâs
â<strong>configure</strong>â directory should be used to define module
dependencies and each module respective locations (e.g. work, prod).
Only dependencies that are actually being used should be listed in this
file since this information is used to decide what modules to rebuild
when a new version of a dependency becomes available.</p>
<p>The potential exists for conflicting dependencies, for example where a
module has a dependency on multiple modules, which may also have
dependencies on a common module. In principle, only a single, specified
version of a dependent module should be used everywhere when a module is
built. Such conflicts are automatically detected and flagged at build
time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="redirector">
<h2>Redirector<a class="headerlink" href="#redirector" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The ADE has a mechanism (the âredirectorâ) to allow switching an IOC
from one version to another without having to change the IOC boot
parameters. This is done by creating a soft file link with a fixed name
that points to the actual boot script file to be used by the IOC.</p>
<p>The redirector links are kept in â<em>/gem_sw/prod/redirector</em>â. The
ADE provides a tool to switch an IOC from one version to another
(â<strong>configure-ioc</strong>â). Under no circumstances the links should be
changed by hand since this may introduce inconsistencies in the setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="naming-conventions">
<h2>Naming Conventions<a class="headerlink" href="#naming-conventions" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="version-numbers">
<h3>Version Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#version-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>When new software is released it needs a new version number. Weâll use
an adaptation of the Semantic Versioning system that uses a sequence of
three digits (Major, Minor, Patch).</p>
<p>Major version numbers change whenever there is some significant change
being introduced. Minor version numbers change when a minor feature or
bug fix is introduced, or when a set of smaller features is rolled out.
Patch numbers are optional and will be reserved for bug fixes of
released code.</p>
<p>The Major number should start from one. The Minor version number and the
Patch number can start from zero.</p>
<div class="section" id="ioc-modules">
<h4>IOC Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#ioc-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>The version number for an IOC should use the following naming
convention: <strong>&lt;major&gt;-&lt;minor&gt;[-p&lt;patch&gt;]</strong></p>
<p>Bug fixes applied to the trunk will increase the â<strong>&lt;minor&gt;</strong>â
number.</p>
<p>The â<strong>&lt;patch&gt;</strong>â number will only be used when releasing a bug fix
from a released version of the software thatâs no longer in the trunk. A
â<strong>p</strong>â â should be placed before theâ <em>&lt;patch&gt;</em>â â number to
separate it from the rest of the version number.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support-modules">
<h4>Support Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#support-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>Support modules written within Gemini will follow the same naming
convention as IOC modules.</p>
<div class="section" id="vendor-support-modules">
<h5>Vendor Support Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#vendor-support-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h5>
<p>Vendor support modules that already had a version number assigned by the
original author will use the following naming convention:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>&lt;original-version&gt;-&lt;minor&gt;[-p&lt;patch&gt;]</strong></div></blockquote>
<p>where â<strong>&lt;original-version&gt;</strong>â will be the version assigned by the
original author.</p>
<p>The â<strong>&lt;minor&gt;</strong>â number will be increased any time a modification
is made after the module was incorporated to the ADE. It should be
omitted if no modifications were needed to incorporate the package.</p>
<p>No major number is used in vendor software since we donât expect major
modifications in this case. However, if this were necessary, then
probably a new module should be created.</p>
<p>The â<strong>&lt;patch&gt;</strong>â number will be used a bug fix from previously
released version of the software (unlikely). A â<strong>p</strong>â â should be
placed before the â <em>&lt;</em>â <em>patch&gt;</em>â number to separate it from the
rest of the version number.</p>
<p>A file called â<strong>VERSION</strong>â should be created in the module top
directory to keep track of the original version, if the module does not
include one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="branches">
<h4>Branches<a class="headerlink" href="#branches" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>Branch names should be a string describing the purpose of the branch.
The name should start with a letter to avoid confusing it with a version
number.</p>
<p>If a release is made from a branch, the name of the branch should be
included in the released version as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>&lt;major&gt;-&lt;minor&gt;-&lt;branch&gt;-&lt;release&gt;-[-p&lt;patch&gt;]</strong></div></blockquote>
<p>Where â<strong>&lt;major&gt;</strong>â and â<strong>&lt;minor&gt;</strong>â refer to the version the
branch was derived from. Bug fixes applied to the branch will increase
the â<strong>&lt;release&gt;</strong>â number.</p>
<p>The <strong>&lt;</strong>â <strong>patch&gt;</strong> number will only be used when releasing a bug
fix from a released version of theâ software thatâs no longer in the
branch âtrunkâ. A ââ<strong>p</strong>ââ should be placed before the â<em>&lt;patch&gt;</em>
number to separate it from the rest of the version number.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>â: Please note that the preferred method is to first merge the
branch into the trunk and use the normal convention for version numbers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ioc-names">
<h3>IOC Names<a class="headerlink" href="#ioc-names" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The operation of the ADE depends on a consistent naming scheme being
adopted for all operational IOCs. The host name of the IOC must be set
correctly to enable it to automatically locate and access the scripts
and application software for use with the IOC. Gemini IOCs have names of
the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>&lt;system&gt;-&lt;location&gt;-ioc</strong></div></blockquote>
<p>where â<strong>&lt;system&gt;</strong>â is a lowercase string uniquely identifying the
IOC associated with a specific telescope subsystem.</p>
<p>The â<strong>&lt;location&gt;</strong>â is the physical location of the IOC, and can
either <strong>cp</strong>â (Pachon), â <strong>mk</strong>â (Maunaâ Kea), â<strong>hbf</strong>â (Hilo
Base Lab) or â<strong>sbf</strong> (La Serena Lab). For instance, the IOC
controlling the mount atâ Mauna Kea will be â<strong>mcs-mk-ioc</strong>â.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support-module-names">
<h3>Support Module Names<a class="headerlink" href="#support-module-names" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The names of new Gemini support modules should have words capitalized
and should start with a lowercase letter (e.g. mySupportModule). Those

Gemini support modules (e.g. timelib) do not need to be renamed to

<h3>Redirector Links<a class="headerlink" href="#redirector-links" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>For production systems (e.g. the MCS) the redirector link should follow
the same convention as for the IOC names.</p>
<p>For lab systems the redirector link should use the following convention:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>&lt;host name&gt;-&lt;location&gt;-ioc</strong></div></blockquote>
<p>Where, â<strong>&lt;host name&gt;</strong>â is the name of the CPU board hostname (e.g.
labvme1, sim1, etc). The motivation for this is to keep the redirector
directory as clean as possible. Besides, it doesnât make sense to have
more links than actual CPU boards available.</p>
<p>In those cases where a permanently test system is needed (e.g. the TCS
simulator) an âaliasâ entry in the redirector may be created (e.g.
â<em>tcsim-sbf-io</em>âc). However, the preferred method would be to assign
a hostname (and IP address) for this purpose and use that instead.</p>
<p>Systems not following these naming conventions will create clutter in
the system. They will be removed. A review of these will happen at least
once per year. It is everyone responsibility to maintain the redirector
directory clean.</p>

<h2>Normal Development<a class="headerlink" href="#normal-development" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the steady development of a support module or IOC application
using a linear development/release schedule. The code is available or
will be committed to the trunk.</p>
<div class="section" id="initial-development">
<h3>Initial Development<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-development" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>For the case where we are creating a completely â<strong>new</strong>â support
module or IOC application, development begins by running
â<strong>gem-start-new-module.py</strong>â. The user has the option of creating
an entry in the repository at this time.</p>
<p>For the case where we are modifying an existing support module or IOC
application (bug-fixes or adding new features), development begins by
running â<strong>gem-checkout-module.py</strong>â. This will check out the code
from the trunk.</p>
<p>The first stage of the development process will take place in a
sub-directory of the developerâs home directory. Booting the IOC
application will be done from the</p>
<p><strong>/gem_sw/test/&lt;user&gt;</strong>â area. The user will have to set the
â<em>INSTALL_LOCATION</em>â variable in <em>configure/CONFIG_SITE</em>â to make
the build system install the software in the test area.</p>
<p>Note: It is not possible to boot an RTEMS IOC from the userâs home
directory because the OS does not allow booting from directories that
are NFS mounts (â<em>prod</em>â, â<em>work,</em> âandâ <em>test</em>â are located on
the summit, but the home directories at the base facility).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="development-in-work">
<h3>Development in Work<a class="headerlink" href="#development-in-work" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>When the new version on trunk is ready it can be checked out into work
for testing on an operational IOC. â<strong>gem-checkout-module.py</strong>â is
run to check-out the support module or IOC application from the trunk
into the work tree.</p>
<p>Development in work should be restricted only to minor bug fixes found
while testing the module. No changes in the dependencies in the
â<em>configure/RELEASE</em>â file should be made in a software installed in
work to prevent breaking other modules that rely on this software.
Commits to Subversion can be done at any time to provide traceability.</p>
<p>Major reworks to the code should be done in the userâs home directory
and tested as if it were initial development. It can then be redeployed
in work again.</p>
<p>For an IOC application, the script â<strong>configure-ioc</strong>â should be run
to modify the IOC boot script location to set this particular IOC to
boot from the work version. The â<strong>configure-ioc</strong>â script must be
run again so that the production IOC boots from the prod tree once the
testing is finished.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="release-to-production">
<h3>Release to Production<a class="headerlink" href="#release-to-production" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>When the system is ready for release, â<strong>gem-release.py</strong>â is run to
generate a release tag and export the application to the prod area. No
dependencies to modules in work should be present in
â<em>configure/RELEASE</em>â at this point.</p>
<p>By default, â<strong>gem-release.py</strong>â generates a release from the trunk.
It is also possible to create a release from a branch, although, the
preferred method is to merge the branch back into the trunk and then
release from there.</p>
<p><strong>gem-release.py</strong>â will do a test build first, before scheduling the
module to be checked out and built in prod by the build server. The next
time the build cron job runs on the build server, it will notice a
scheduled build, check the module out and build it. The new tagged
version will be created in the repository at this point.</p>
<p>A new release should always come with a short summary under the

<p>Releases should be named according to conventions defined in â<em>Naming

demands, including bug fixes.</p>
<p>A feature branch is created to develop and test the application
including the new feature. This process is basically the same as the
â<em>Initial Development</em>â phase described above. However in this case
development begins by running â<strong>gem-start-feature-branch.py</strong>â
instead of <em>gemstart-new-module.py</em>â or
â<em>gem-checkout-module.py</em>â.</p>
<p>Also â<strong>gem-sync-from-trunk.py</strong>â should be run periodically to keep
the code up to date with what is in trunk.</p>
<p>When complete the feature branch should be merged back into trunk using
the â<strong>svn merge</strong> command.</p>

<p>This occurs when a support module or IOC application has been released
to production (the prodarea), some time has elapsed and bugs have been
found. We have to fix the bugs for this particular release, despite the
fact that further development and later releases of this support module
or IOC application have been made since the release.</p>
<p>This situation is not intended to happen in normal circumstances and it
should be avoided where possible. This process is basically the same as
the Initial Development phase. However in this case development begins
by running â<strong>gem-start-bugfix-branch.py</strong>â rather than
gemstart-new-module.py or gem-checkout-module.py.</p>
<p>Unlike the â<em>Major Development</em>â process, the script

<p>When the software is ready to be released, â<strong>gem-release.py</strong>â

<p>Any software package thatâs not released into
â<strong>/gem_sw/prod/&lt;epics-version&gt;/</strong>â can be managed as a vendor
module within the ADE using the standard development workflow. With the
following differences:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Tagged releases will be made using the Subversion copy command
instead of using the <em>gem-release.py</em>â:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>svn copy &lt;trunk&gt; /gem_sw/release/&lt;module&gt;/&lt;tag&gt;</strong></div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Releasing the software will be done by checking out the code from the
tag into the place where the software is supposed to be installed.</li>

<p><strong>svn checkout &lt;parent directory&gt;/release/&lt;module&gt;/&lt;tag&gt;</strong></p>

<p>Version numbers will be assigned using the same conventions that were
stated in the <em>Version</em>â <em>Numbers</em>â section. This approach has the
